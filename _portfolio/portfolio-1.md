title: "Image To Sentence Generation"
excerpt: "This project looks at how to turn images into sentences using attention mechanisms. We want to see how our model looks at images, picks out important parts, and makes captions that make sense. We're focusing on how visual things and words work together to understand how image captions are made. <br/><img src='images/portfolioimagetosentenceimage.png'>"
